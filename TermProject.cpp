//Task1: You must implement a hash table as your main data structure.You should implement your own hash table, 
//you cannot use a hash table implementation from a library.
//This implementation should be a proper C++ class.
//You should use this hash table for storing the filenames and the corresponding number of visits of that page(filename).
//There is no restriction on the choice of the hash function and collision resolution method.
//
//Task2 : Use std::unordered_map data structure for storing the filenames and the corresponding number of visits.
//Task 3 : In order to compare the efficiency of your own hash table implementation and std::unordered_map, write a program which measures the total time it takes starting from reading access_log file until the end of printing the top 10 most visited pages.There is no need to ask user input.
//Note1 : For finding the top 10 most visited pages try to find an efficient method.Hint : you can use the heap data structures.
//Note2 : Other than the hash table implementation, you can use C++ standard library for your needs.
